# Poverty Mapping in Somalia : Reproducability Guidelines

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of somPovMap is to create a poverty map for Somalia using the Small Area Estimation approach of the Fay Herriot Model (Fay and Herriot, 1979). This ReadMe shows how to reproduce all the tables and results in the paper. You can find the script that generates this readme file as "README.Rmd" in this github working directory. 

## System Set-Up
1)  Please clone the repository and open up the project within RStudio.
    Make sure you are in the project environment. In the top right corner
    you will see the "somPovMap" beside the R logo to show you are in the
    project's environment. This is extremely important. Otherwise you 
    cannot automatically load the user defined functions. 

2)  Please install the R `devtools` package, run
    `install.packages("devtools")`

3) Open `README.Rmd` and go ahead and knit the Markdown file. This file is basically
running the script that produces the poverty map. 

Please see code and outputs below: 


4) Please see the results in the paper below: 

### Basic Descriptive Statistics
```{r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

descriptives_dt <- 
  data.table(tot_pop_million = round(sum(spatial_dt$estimated_population_current, na.rm = TRUE)/1e6, 1),
             pop_hhs_million = round(sum(geosurvey_dt$population_weight, na.rm = TRUE)/1e6, 1),
             svy_hhs = nrow(geosurvey_dt),
             povrate_ipl = 
               geosurvey_dt %>%
               summarise(povrate_ipl = weighted.mean(x = poor,
                                                     w = population_weight,
                                                     na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
               round(4),
             recent_census = 1986 %>% as.integer(),
             region_count_sample = length(unique(geosurvey_dt$admin1Pcod[!is.na(geosurvey_dt$admin1Pcod)])),
             median_cv_region = 
               directpov_dt %>%
               summarize(median = median(directpov_dt$CV/100, na.rm = TRUE)),
             mean_cv_region = 
               directpov_dt %>%
               summarize(mean = weighted.mean(x = directpov_dt$CV/100, 
                                              w = directpov_dt$SampSize,
                                              na.rm = TRUE)),
             num_targets_pop = length(unique(spatial_dt$admin2Pcod[!is.na(spatial_dt$admin2Pcod)])),
             num_targets_sample = length(unique(spatial_dt$admin2Pcod[!is.na(spatial_dt$admin2Pcod)]))) %>%
  t() %>%
  kable()


descriptives_dt

```

    
### FH Model Results and Diagnostics
This contains the results seen in Tables 3 & 4

```{r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

summary(fhmodel_not)

```


### Residual Plots and Q-Q plots
This contains the figures 1 in the paper and figure 4 in the appendix


```{r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

plot(fhmodel_not)

```




### Poverty Maps
```{r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

povshp_dt %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = FH)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "H") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(fill = "Poverty Rate")


povshp_dt %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = FH * estimated_population_current)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "H") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(fill = "Population \nof Poor")


```


### Comparing the Estimated and Direct Poverty Rates at Province Level
This is the figure 2 in the paper and the table 5 in the appendix

```{r, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}

provpov_dt %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admin1Name)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = provFH), color = "blue", size = 2) +  # Plotting provFH
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = DirectLB, ymax = DirectUB), width = 0.2, color = "red") +  # Error bars for DirectLB and DirectUB
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +  # Adding a horizontal line at y = 0
  labs(x = "Province", y = "Poverty Rate") +  # Labeling axes
  theme_bw() +  # Setting a white background theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotating x-axis labels for better readability

provpov_dt[, c("admin1Name","Direct", "DirectLB", "DirectUB")] %>%
  kable()

```
